Create a pod called my-busybox in the dev2406 namespace using the busybox image. The container should be called secret and should sleep for 3600 seconds.

The container should mount a read-only secret volume called secret-volume at the path /etc/secret-volume. The secret being mounted has already been created for you and is called dotfile-secret.

Make sure that the pod is scheduled on controlplane and no other node in the cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    app: my-busybox
  name: my-busybox
  namespace: dev2406
spec:
  containers:
    - command:
      - sleep
      - "3600"
      image: busybox
      name: secret
      volumeMounts:
        - name: secret-volume
          mountPath: /etc/secret-volume
  volumes:
    - name: secret-volume
      secret:
        secretName: dotfile-secret
  nodeSelector:
    kubernetes.io/hostname: controlplane
```
