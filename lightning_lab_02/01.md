We have deployed a few pods in this cluster in various namespaces.

Inspect them and identify the pod which is not in a Ready state. Troubleshoot and fix the issue.

Next, add a check to restart the container on the same pod if the command `ls /var/www/html/file_check fails`.

This check should start after a delay of `10` seconds and run every `60` seconds.

You may delete and recreate the object. Ignore the warnings from the probe.

```shell
kubectl get pod -A
```

```yaml
    readinessProbe:
      failureThreshold: 3
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 9080
        scheme: HTTP
      periodSeconds: 10
      successThreshold: 1
      timeoutSeconds: 1
    livenessProbe:
      exec:
        command:
          - ls
          - /var/www/html/file_check
      periodSeconds: 60
      initialDelaySeconds: 10
```
